            <strong>see if you can identify the pest</strong>
            <p>Everyone needs to keep an eye out for symptoms of huanglongbing.Huanglongbing is  spread by the movement of infected plants and plant propagative material and by  sap sucking insects. These insects – the Asiatic citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) and African citrus  psyllid (Trioza erytreae) – are not  present in Australia and are of major concern due to their ability to spread  huanglongbing.The  African citrus psyllid is similar but larger with a light brown-grey body and  black head, and large transparent forewings.Huanglongbing  causes yellowing of citrus plant leaves and in some instances deformed, sour and bitter fruit.In  well-managed orchards, a yellowing that spreads slowly over the tree and  through an orchard is an easily seen sign. The spreading yellowing effect can be especially  hard to see in neglected backyard citrus trees growing in poor soils.If you work around imported plant material, including citrus  fruit, cut flowers and nursery stock you need to look for disease symptoms and  insect vectors.Ensure that that  propagation material is purchased from suppliers that source their budwood from          Auscitrus.If huanglongbing established in Australia it could infect  all commercially grown citrus varieties, some Australian native and citrus  relatives, including          Murraya (native  and ornamental varieties of orange jessamine and curry tree). Orange, mandarins and tangelos are known to be  the most susceptible, whilst grapefruit and lemons have moderate  susceptibility. Limes are the least susceptible to the disease.Any psyllid on citrus should be considered suspect. They can be  confused with aphids. However, when compared with aphids, they are more active  and jump readily when disturbed. They are most commonly found on new, tender  growth of any commercially grown citrus, as well as some Australian native  citrus.Keep a  watch for sick citrus trees in your area. A general decline accompanied by  fruit becoming deformed, sour and bitter, or a spreading yellowing in orchards,  are signs of the disease.</p>

            <strong>Check what can legally come into australia</strong>
            <p>All Australians and international tourists have a role to  keep out exotic pests and diseases.Huanglongbing and  its insect vectors are present in a number of countries. Australia  remains free of both the exotic vectors and the disease-causing bacterium. We  need your help to keep it this way.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether  you are a:The only way to rid citrus orchards of the  disease is to replace infected trees and control insect vectors, so the cost of  an outbreak to Australia’s citrus industry would be enormous. If huanglongbing  established in Australia, most backyard citrus trees would not survive for more  than a few years.Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions  to be allowed into Australia. Please check the          Biosecurity  Import Condition System (BICON).Be aware of any relevant biosecurity measures that may be in  place for incoming goods and conveyances.          Industry advice  notices are reviewed regularly and could change.</p>

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment is critical. This could be as easy as bagging a  suspect plant specimen that has symptoms or stopping an insect escaping by  closing the doors on a shipping container.Controlling  vectors and removing infected plant material are the only control options, in  conjunction with movement restrictions on infected plant material, to limit its  spread. Identification and use of resistant plant stock may provide a long term  management option, as the disease would be nearly impossible to eradicate.</p>
