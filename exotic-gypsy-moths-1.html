            <p>Everyone needs to keep an eye out for gypsy moths and egg masses.The gypsy moth would most likely enter Australia in the egg  stage, as it spends a significant proportion of its life cycle on non-host  material as eggs. Asian gypsy moth egg masses are tolerant of extremes in  temperature and moisture.Egg masses can be transported domestically or  internationally on:The flight season (July – September) until hatching time  (April – May) is the most likely period that viable eggs could enter Australia.Caterpillars  have a significant appetite and high populations can completely defoliate trees  causing them to die. Two to three years of  defoliation often result in significant tree death, especially if the trees are  also stressed by drought.Gypsy  moths produce one generation per year and mature through four main life stages.Adult males are of a grey-brown colour and a wingspan of  30-40mm and females are pale yellow with wavy dark brown bands across the  forewing and have a wingspan of 40-70mm.Gypsy  moths can be a serious nuisance in urban environments.If you work around imported goods you need to look for gypsy  moths or their egg masses attached to:Take action if you find a moth or egg mass that looks like  it could be a gypsy moth.The caterpillars feed on the leaves of more than 1000  species of trees, such as:Older larvae will also feed on a number of conifers such as:Check these plants regularly.Good biosecurity measures including inspecting equipment and  packaging before it arrives on your property will help prevent entry and  establishment. It is also a good idea to keep records of plant purchases,  particularly where they are sourced from.Gypsy moths are a minor risk to human health and are  regarded as a nuisance pest because they cause reduced tree growth, crown  dieback and its eventual death.</p>

            <strong>Check what can legally come into australia</strong>
            <p>All Australians and international tourists have a role to  keep out exotic pests and diseases.Gypsy moths are native to northern hemisphere countries. Australia  remains free of this exotic pest. We need your help to keep it this way.Check what you can and cannot bring into Australia, whether  you are a:While all gypsy moth species pose a biosecurity risk to  Australia, the risk of entry and establishment varies depending on the biology  of each species. The female European gypsy moth cannot fly, potentially  limiting the distance over which it can spread. However, even flightless gypsy  moths can potentially spread through the ballooning of larvae. The females of  other species are capable of flying, allowing them to lay their eggs on cargo, ships  and aircrafts, which may disperse them internationally.Gypsy moths can spread via numerous pathways, including:Some items, by law, are subject to certain import conditions  to be allowed into Australia. Please check the          Biosecurity  Import Condition System (BICON).Be aware of any gypsy moth biosecurity measures that may be  in place for incoming goods and conveyances.          Industry advice  notices are reviewed regularly and could change.</p>

            <strong>secure any suspect specimens</strong>
            <p>Containment is crucial. If you suspect you’ve seen a gypsy  moth, take a photo and record the location.Inspect area for egg masses and place them in a sealed  container.</p>
